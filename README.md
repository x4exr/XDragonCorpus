# XDragonCorpus
Mathematical SIMD decompilation of Corpus_64.dll into Rust.

Can be used to port Objec Delay or Ableton Live Corpus into any other DAW through Steinberg VSTs (JUCE).

# DECOMPILING IS ILLEGAL
Or is it? This is of a confusing matter. I will say this. I am not responsible for any legal troubles you encounter. Do what ever. I do not care.

# Notes
Decompiled primarily through Ghidra. Rust code was created by me. Simple short parameters extracted via ChatGPT.
