> Will continue active development of this during the DAW project. This is long into the future. If you understand what you're doing, please open an issue and I'll provide compiler and dll tools for decipering the varnames.
> YOU NEED ABLETON to do this. A DLL debugger has to be loaded to observe samples and how they transform.

# XDragonCorpus
Mathematical SIMD decompilation of Corpus_64.dll into Rust.

Can be used to port Objec Delay or Ableton Live Corpus into any other DAW through Steinberg VSTs (JUCE).

# DECOMPILING IS ILLEGAL
Or is it? This is of a confusing matter. I will say this. I am not responsible for any legal troubles you encounter. Do what ever. I do not care.

# Notes
Decompiled primarily through Ghidra. Rust code was created by me. Simple short parameters extracted via ChatGPT.

# Block Flow
